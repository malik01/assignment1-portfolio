    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>
        I as an app developer get to see many apps with an alien UI that is very hard 
to understand and can get frustrating, so as being undergone these circumstances 
i want the other users to not undergo the same process and make things a little 
easier for them
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a gamer and want to be a game devaloper for companies like 
Ubisoft,Bethsda,SONY or EA.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a Web developer i want to make professional looking websites with an 
intuitive and an easy to use design rather than going here and there to add just 
an item into the cart.
    </p>
    <p>
        Usually when visiting websites they seem to be dull and not very interactive, 
so i want to change that and make a really interactive website thats pleasing to 
the eye and very easy to use
