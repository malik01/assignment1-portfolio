                    I as an app developer get to see many apps with an alien UI that is very hard 
to understand and can get frustrating, so as being undergone these circumstances 
i want the other users to not undergo the same process and make things a little 
easier for them
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a Web developer i want to make professional looking websites with an 
intuitive and an easy to use design rather than going here and there to add just 
an item into the cart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Usually when visiting websites they seem to be dull and not very interactive, 
so i want to change that and make a really interactive website thats pleasing to 
the eye and very easy to use
